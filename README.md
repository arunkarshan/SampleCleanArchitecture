# Sample Clean Arch

A Sample project exhibiting the implementation of Clean Architecture with MVVM, Data Binding, Dependency Injection etc.


In the project, I am obtaining a sample order list from https://boiling-dusk-12902.herokuapp.com, and further obtaining the details of each order item along with the price and discount details from different API, and combining them to display a list.

I am using Firebase RTDB as the login server, and comparing the user credentials in the app repositrory class, for easiness.
